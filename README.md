# Preparing For Influenza Season Data Analysis

_The Preparing For Influenza Season Data Analysis Project is a part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program. It involves analyzing data of the US population and influenza deaths by various demographics to help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand._

## Project Goal
The project involves analyzing data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Census Bureau to help a medical staffing agency devise a plan for staffing needs across the United States before and during flu season.

## Data
The data set on influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender is provided by the CDC.

Data on the US population by geography is provided by the US Census Bureau.

Both datasets are uploaded to this repository [here](https://github.com/goghcore/us-influenza-season-data-analysis/tree/main/data/original-data).

_Note: As the population data are estimates, the sum of the numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total._

# Methods
To achieve the project's goals, two analysis methods are employed:

Historic Analysis: By conducting an in-depth analysis of historical influenza data, patterns and trends related to flu-related complications and deaths can be identified. This analysis helps identify areas with higher risk and vulnerability.

Predictive Analysis: Utilizing predictive modeling techniques, the project forecasts the expected impact of flu season based on historical data and other relevant factors. This enables the medical staffing agency to anticipate staffing needs in different regions.

# Tools
In this project, Excel, Loom, and Tableau are utilized as tools.

The project involves sourcing, profiling, transforming, and integrating data using Excel. Statistical hypothesis testing is subsequently performed using Excel's Data Analysis tools. Tableau is employed to create a data narrative, guiding the stakeholders through various aspects of the prevention strategy. Lastly, Loom is employed to provide the audio component for the presentation.

## Result & Recommendations
**In response to state risk:** Vulnerable people are at risk of flu-related complications & death. States with large percentages of vulnerable population should be prioritized (e.g. California, Florida, New York).

**Proactive staffing:** To ensure that medical centers have enough staff to handle the increase in patients during the peak months of December through March, the medical staffing agency should start sending staff to medical centers before December, ideally in November.
