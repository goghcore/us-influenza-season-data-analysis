# Preparing For Influenza Season Data Analysis Project
This is a project in the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course.
## Project Goal
The project involves analyzing data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Census Bureau to help a medical staffing agency devise a plan for staffing needs across the United States before and during flu season.
## Data
The data set on influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender is provided by the CDC.

Data on the US population by geography is provided by the US Census Bureau.

Both datasets are uploaded to this repository [here](https://github.com/goghcore/us-influenza-season-data-analysis/tree/main/data/original-data).

_Note:_ As the population data are estimates, the sum of the numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total.
## Result & Recommendations
**In response to state risk:** Vulnerable people are at risk of flu-related complications & death. States with large percentages of vulnerable population should be prioritized (e.g. California, Florida, New York).

**Proactive staffing:** To ensure that medical centers have enough staff to handle the increase in patients during the peak months of December through March, the medical staffing agency should start sending staff to medical centers before December, ideally in November.
